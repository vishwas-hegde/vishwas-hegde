# Hello, I'm Vishwas Hegde

## About Me
I am a passionate and dedicated Robotics Engineer with a strong background in motion planning, deep learning, and software development. Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Robotics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation in the field of robotics.

## Work Experience
### Computer Vision/Deep Learning Intern | Rapiscan Systems | Billerica, MA (Jun 2024 - Present)
- Implemented an Attention-based Residual UNet network to denoise X-ray images, achieving a PSNR of ~29 dB.
- Explored super-resolution diffusion models to denoise and enhance X-ray image quality.
- Deployed the deep learning pipeline on Azure.
  
### Graduate Research Assistant | ELPIS LAB | Worcester, MA (Jan 2024 - Present)
- Collaborating with Dr. Constantinos Chamzas, I am actively involved in developing cutting-edge Deep Reinforcement Learning models to optimize motion planning parameters for robotic arms, enhancing efficiency and adaptability.

### Software Developer | Saint Gobain India Pvt Ltd | Chennai, India (Sep 2021 – May 2023)
- Spearheaded the design and implementation of an integrated HMI and PLC system, significantly improving workflow efficiency and usability for production line operators.
- Led optimization initiatives resulting in a 15% increase in server performance and a 30% reduction in material wastage through the implementation of an alert system for hoppers.
- Contributed to the integration of production data with SAP and MES systems, streamlining processes and enhancing quality control.

## Projects
### Learning Parameters for Kinodynamic Motion Planning (Jan 2024 – Present)
- Developing CNN models to optimize parameters for motion planners, aiming to reduce computational time in kinematic chain motion planning scenarios.

### UAV Interception using Linear Quadratic Control (Oct 2023 – Dec 2023)
- Designed and tuned controllers for quadrotor trajectory control and aerial interception, integrating Kalman filters for state estimation.

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping Robot (Oct 2020 – May 2021)
- Implemented SLAM techniques with ROS Navigation Stack, enhancing localization and mapping accuracy using sensor fusion techniques.

### All-Terrain Vehicle Development (Apr 2018 – Apr 2021)
- Led the development of a high-performance all-terrain vehicle, optimizing vehicle dynamics and reducing un-sprung mass by 30%.
